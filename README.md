# TodoCli:

TodoCli is a Todo App for the terminal which supports nested lists and tasks. Lists can
contain tasks and more lists.

## Installation:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this Repo (temporarily)
3. Run the install shell script for your OS, which will create a ```~/bin``` directory and put
an executable version of the program there. Then it will add ```~/bin``` to your
```$PATH``` environment variable.
4. Now you can delete this cloned Repository, and after restarting your terminal,
you should be able to use the command ```todocli```
